# EVM qr code data transmission protocol 

#### CDDL for EVM Sign Request.
The following specification is written in Concise Data Definition Language [CDDL].
UUIDs in this specification notated uuid are CBOR binary strings tagged with #6.37, per the IANA CBOR Tags Registry.


```
; Metadata for the signing request for ethereum.
; request-id is the identifier for this signing request.
; sign-data is the data to be signed.
; data-type is to indicate what is the data to be signed. Different chains have different type values.
; custom-chain-identifier is to show which chain it is. 
; derivation-path is the path of the private key to sign the data.
; address is the ethereum address of the signing type for verification purpose which is optional
; origin is to show where the data from.

#### CDDL for Evm Signature.
The following specification is written in Concise Data Definition Language [CDDL].

```
evm-signature  = (
    request-id: uuid,
    signature: evm-signature-bytes
)
evm-signature-bytes = bytes .size, variable length ;currently the signature of the signing request (r,s) is 64 for EVMOS.
